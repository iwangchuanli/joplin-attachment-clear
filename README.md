# joplin-attachment-clear

Removes attachments (resources) that are not referred (orphaned) in Joplin. 

**:warning: Always backup and use at your own risk! :warning:**

Tested with Joplin 2.1.9 (prod, win32) Revision: 882d66383 + Python 3.8. 

## Known Limitations

1. Resources that are only referred in note histories are marked as orphaned. 
2. If the sync is incomplete, or the states of Joplin across all devices are not the same, this script might cause resources used in current version accidentally deleted.

## Requirements

Python 3.6+ (for `f-string`)

No third-party dependencies.

## How it works?
When exporting notes to a JEX file, the attachments not referred will be ignored. JEX file is just a TAR file, and by reading the attachment ids under its `resources` folder, a list of referred attachment can be created. 

In Joplin, a full list of all attachments can be found via `Tools` - `Note Attachments...`. Joplin Data API also allows the list to be fetched programmatically. 

Thus, the attachments that are not referred (orphaned) can be calculated using the difference between the all attachment set and the referred attachment set.

## Usage
```
usage: vacuum.py [-h] [--port PORT] [--token TOKEN] [--limit LIMIT] [--confirm] [--test-del-1] jex_path

positional arguments:
  jex_path       Path to the JEX file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --port PORT    the port used to connect to Joplin, leave blank for auto query
  --token TOKEN  override API token
  --limit LIMIT  pagenation limit for querying attachments from Joplin
  --confirm      Confirm deletion
  --test-del-1   (For testing purpose) Removing one not referred attachment. Need to be used with confirm.
```

## Recommend Procedure
0. Before proceeding, make sure Joplin on all of your devices are synced to a same state. 

1. Start Joplin, and export all notes to a JEX file. (`File - Export All - JEX`)

2. Backup the Joplin database, by close Joplin and copy the `joplin-desktop` folder. (The full path can be find using the `Settings - General` panel)

3. Disable automatic synchronization for now, in order to prevent sync being triggered during the vacuum process. (`Settings - Synchronization - Synchronization interval - Disabled`) Also, do not perform any update on other clients to avoid versioning issues.

4. Run the script in dry-run mode. For the first run you will need to grant access from Joplin GUI. Check if the orphaned files found are actually orphan or not. 
   ```bash
   python vacuum.py [JEX_PATH]
   ```

5. Run the script using `--test-del-1` and `--confirm` flag. This will removes 1 orphaned attachment while leaving others intact. This step checks if everything is working, including the deletion operation. Try to initiate sync after this step. If Joplin shows `Removing remote object: 1` and finishes the sync, then it's good to go.
    ```bash
    python vacuum.py [JEX_PATH] --confirm --test-del-1
    ```

6. If it works fine, only use `--confirm` flag to remove all orphaned attachments.
    ```bash
    python vacuum.py [JEX_PATH] --confirm
    ```

7. Perform a manual sync (by pressing `Ctrl+S` or click the `Synchronize` button), and check the count of `Removing remote object` is as expected. If the manual sync finished successfully, then you can enable the automatic sync, as well as manually sync on other devices.

## Additional Info

1. It is possible to perform the vacuum process without human intervention (e.g. use `cron` to schedule). But it is not recommended. First, you will need other tools that can create a JEX export programmatically. Then, performing the vacuum without disabling all writing may cause inconsistencies on states. 

## Example Output
